# timed schedule

This repo contains the follow demos of using the clock-zones crate for timed automata

- `simulate_execution`: Simulate execution (the least interesting way to use symbolic representations of time constraints).
- `check_schedule`: Check if the constraints are feasible to schedule.
- `generate_schedule`: Produce a feasible schedule based on the constraints.
